Me using HTML, SASS and JS to make my portfolio.

<p><b><a href="https://anh-portfolio.netlify.app/">Netlify Pages</a></b> if you're interested.</p>

<p><b>Future plan:</b> Make the website more "legit" after I learn more about JS and React.</p>

<b><h1>The files on git are not the one on the live server. I uploaded everything on Netlify since Git Page was giving me a hard time.</b></h1>
